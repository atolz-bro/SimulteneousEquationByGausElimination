# SimulteneousEquationByGausElimination
This is a Java Program that helps to solve simulteneous equations of any number of equations and variables(e,g 3 by 3, 5 by 5 e.t.c)

It solves the simulteneous equation by reducing the system to Echelon Form, the variables can then be solved by back substitution

Example<br>
Solve:<br>
&nbsp;1x + 1y -1z = 1<br>
&nbsp;8x + 3y -6z = 1<br>
-4x - 1y + 3z = 1<br>
This system has 3 equations and 4 variables, equivalent to 3 rows and 4 columns<br>
To solve this pass in the co-efficients of each row to the program<br>
